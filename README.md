# Real-Time Data Pipeline with Kafka, Wikimedia, and OpenSearch

## Introduction
This project demonstrates a real-time data pipeline that streams data from Wikimedia using Kafka and indexes it into OpenSearch. The goal is to handle high-velocity data streams efficiently and make the data searchable and analyzable.

## Objectives
- Set up a Kafka producer to read real-time stream data from Wikimedia.
- Develop a Kafka consumer to ingest this data and index it into OpenSearch.
- Ensure the data pipeline is scalable and robust.

## Technologies Used
- **Kafka:** Distributed streaming platform for building real-time data pipelines.
- **Wikimedia:** Source of the real-time data stream.
- **OpenSearch:** Distributed search and analytics engine.
- **OkHttp EventSource:** Library for handling streaming data from Wikimedia.

## Architecture Overview
1. **Kafka Producer:** Reads data from the Wikimedia stream and publishes it to a Kafka topic.
2. **Kafka Broker:** Manages the stream of data.
3. **Kafka Consumer:** Reads data from Kafka and indexes it into OpenSearch.

## Detailed Implementation

### Kafka Producer
- Configured to read data from Wikimedia's real-time stream.
- Published the data to a Kafka topic for further processing.

### Kafka Broker
- Efficiently managed the stream of data from the producer to the consumer.

### Kafka Consumer
- Consumed data from the Kafka topic.
- Indexed the data into OpenSearch for search and analysis.

#### Setup Kafka Producer
Configure Kafka producer properties including the broker address, key, and value serializers. Use the `okhttp-eventsource` library to connect to the Wikimedia stream and handle incoming events.

##Challenges and Solutions
1. Handling Large Volumes of Data: Scaled Kafka brokers and OpenSearch clusters to manage the data flow.
2. Data Consistency: Implemented proper error handling and retries in the Kafka consumer to ensure data consistency during indexing.

## Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the integration of Kafka with Wikimedia and OpenSearch, forming a robust real-time data pipeline. The system can handle high-velocity data streams and provides a scalable solution for real-time data ingestion and analysis.

## Future Work
1. Implement advanced data processing and transformation before indexing.
2. Add monitoring and alerting for the pipeline to ensure high availability and reliability.
3. Explore other sources of data to integrate into the pipeline.

By implementing this project, I gained a deeper understanding of Kafka, real-time data processing, and OpenSearch, and learned how to build scalable and efficient data pipelines
