# Real-Time Data Pipeline with Kafka, Wikimedia, and Elasticsearch

## Introduction
This project demonstrates a real-time data pipeline that streams data from Wikimedia using Kafka and indexes it into Elasticsearch. The goal is to handle high-velocity data streams efficiently and make the data searchable and analyzable.

## Objectives
- Set up a Kafka producer to read real-time stream data from Wikimedia.
- Develop a Kafka consumer to ingest this data and index it into Elasticsearch.
- Ensure the data pipeline is scalable and robust.

## Technologies Used
- **Kafka:** Distributed streaming platform for building real-time data pipelines.
- **Wikimedia:** Source of the real-time data stream.
- **Elasticsearch:** Distributed search and analytics engine.
- **OkHttp EventSource:** Library for handling streaming data from Wikimedia.

## Architecture Overview
1. **Kafka Producer:** Reads data from the Wikimedia stream and publishes it to a Kafka topic.
2. **Kafka Broker:** Manages the stream of data.
3. **Kafka Consumer:** Reads data from Kafka and indexes it into Elasticsearch.

## Detailed Implementation

### Kafka Producer
The Kafka producer consumes the stream of data from Wikimedia and publishes it to a Kafka topic.

#### Setup Kafka Producer
Configure Kafka producer properties including the broker address, key, and value serializers. Use the `okhttp-eventsource` library to connect to the Wikimedia stream and handle incoming events.

##Challenges and Solutions
1. Handling Large Volumes of Data: Ensured the Kafka broker and Elasticsearch cluster are appropriately scaled.
2. Data Consistency: Implemented proper error handling and retries in the Kafka consumer to ensure data consistency during indexing.

##Conclusion
This project successfully demonstrates the integration of Kafka with Wikimedia and Elasticsearch, forming a robust real-time data pipeline. The system can handle high-velocity data streams and provides a scalable solution for real-time data ingestion and analysis.

##Future Work
1. Implement advanced data processing and transformation before indexing.
2. Add monitoring and alerting for the pipeline to ensure high availability and reliability.
3. Explore other sources of data to integrate into the pipeline.

By implementing this project, I gained a deeper understanding of Kafka, real-time data processing, and Elasticsearch, and learned how to build scalable and efficient data pipelines
